#CineMates
*CineMates20* is a mobile application for movie buffs.
## Purpose of the project
The project was originally an assignment for a college exam done 6-handed with other colleagues. 
I wanted to take it back to practice new concepts and refine/add features specified later.
## Planned functionality for the app
*Checkboxes are present as I plan to check off implemented features; obviously unchecked features are in progress or not yet started.*
 - [ ] Possibility to search for movies also through filters
 - [ ] Display movies similar to a given movie 
 - [ ] Display additional information about a movie, such as the cast, crew and more.
 - [ ] Ability to create your own custom lists, as well as 3 basic lists - viewed, must-see, and favorites.
 - [ ] Ability to view collections of films related to a particular saga.
 - [ ] Display trailers but also posters or backgrounds related to a particular film.
 - [ ] Possibility of using a random decision system based on some parameters input by the user, for the choice of a film in moments of indecision.
