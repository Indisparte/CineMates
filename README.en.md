# CineMates

## Project Overview
Many times it happens that we want to discover new films by searching the internet for films of a specific genre: "films to watch", "mind blowing films", "films to cry". The purpose of *CineMates* is to group all these searches and needs under one roof. With the addition of multiple utilities.

This app uses the API from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## API Key Note
**Define key in build.gradle**

Find a file called `local.properties` in the `.gradle` file in the home directory.

Add `apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY"` to this file.

## Why this Project

To become an Android developer, you need to know how to bring particular 
particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how to build
